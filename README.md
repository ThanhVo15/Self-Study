# StudyPython
## 1. Introduction
Hello everyone, welcome to my first folder in the "Study with Travis" project. In this folder, I will upload all my code as I progress on my journey to learn Python using Mr. Tran Duy Thanh's video course. Since this is a study folder, it may contain simple or imperfect code, so please refrain from judging me.
    
**Why?**
After completing numerous projects in data analysis and participating in various competitions, I have come to the realization that I have become overly dependent on ChatGPT. I find myself unable to create my own solutions due to my lack of a strong foundation. I am determined to delve deeper into this field and utilize my own brain and intelligence to develop my own code.
